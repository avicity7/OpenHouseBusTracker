## What we do

Through this platform, we digitise the operations needed to manage and track the Buses used for Singapore Polytechnic's Open House event in realtime.


## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** SvelteKit, TailwindCSS

**Backend:** Go, PostgreSQL

## Installation
Run `cd frontend` then `yarn` to install dependencies. Get the frontend started by running `yarn dev`.

From the `/frontend` folder, run `cd ../backend` to get into the backend folder and run `go run .`. Installation of dependencies will be automatically handled.

## Environment Variables

You'll need .env variables to run everything, contact [@avicity7](https://github.com/avicity7) if you don't have them.


## Deployment

We're live at [https://open-house-bus-tracker.vercel.app/]!
